<!-- # js-streams-sbx

An excercise I did to understand streams
In this case there's a consumer that generates data and there's consumer that outputs the data

The idea was to throttle the consumer's capacity so that the producer creates a situation of backpressure and recovers from it.

When the writable stream returns false on write the system creates a one and only event handler after the drain event so that it that resumes the writing

## This helped me understand concepts like
throttling
backpressure
producer-consumer pattern
recovery
backpressure handling

## Applications

Sending files or big chunks of data over the network
Sending big files to many clients
Mitigate denial of service attacks that exhausts the memory by throttlinng the capacity of the consumer  -->

# JS Streams Exercise - Producer-Consumer Pattern with Backpressure Handling

This repository showcases a practical implementation of Node.js streams, focusing on key concepts such as throttling, backpressure, and the producer-consumer pattern. The project simulates a scenario where a producer generates data faster than the consumer can process, highlighting the use of backpressure handling to manage this imbalance.

## Overview

The code demonstrates a Writable stream (outStream) with a limited internal buffer size (highWaterMark). When this buffer fills up, the stream applies backpressure, forcing the producer to pause until the consumer is ready to resume processing data.

## Key Concepts:

**Throttling:** The consumer is simulated to process data at a slower rate than the producer.

**Backpressure:** The producer must pause when the consumer's buffer is full, preventing memory overload.

**Producer-Consumer Pattern:** The interaction between the data generator (producer) and the data processor (consumer).

**Recovery from Backpressure:** The producer resumes once the consumer's buffer drains and is ready for more data.

## Practical Applications:

This project can be applied to:

**Large File Transfers:** Efficiently sending large files over a network without overwhelming the receiving system.

**Data Streaming to Multiple Clients:** Managing data streams for multiple clients while maintaining optimal memory usage.

**Preventing Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Throttling the consumer's processing rate helps mitigate potential DoS attacks that exhaust memory resources.

## How It Works:

**Producer:** Continuously generates chunks of data (Buffer.from('Chunk n')).

**Consumer:** Processes each chunk through a writable stream, with a simulated delay (via setTimeout) to throttle processing speed.

**Backpressure:** When the writable stream’s buffer is full, it returns false, causing the producer to wait for the "drain" event before resuming the write operation.

**Finish Event:** Once all data has been processed, the stream emits the "finish" event.

## Performance Considerations

Node.js streams provide a highly efficient way to process large amounts of data by breaking it into smaller chunks and managing memory usage through backpressure. This prevents overwhelming the system, making it ideal for handling big files or large-scale data streams.

## Why Backpressure Matters

**Efficient Memory Management:** Without backpressure, unbounded data can fill up memory quickly, leading to performance degradation or crashes.

**Real-Time Data Handling:** Streams ensure real-time, continuous data processing without blocking the event loop.

**Scalability:** Applications can scale better when data flow is controlled efficiently.

## Edge Cases

This project addresses:

**Buffer Overflows:** The highWaterMark value ensures that the consumer doesn’t overload the memory with unprocessed data.

**Slow Consumers:** Simulating slow data consumption helps demonstrate how backpressure prevents overwhelming the consumer.

**Producer Pauses:** The producer is paused automatically when the consumer cannot handle additional data, ensuring smooth data flow recovery.

## Technologies Used

**Node.js:** Core technology used for handling streams and managing data flow.
**JavaScript:** The programming language used in this project.

## How to Run

`git clone git@github.com:IvanDerlich/js-streams-sbx.git`

`cd js-streams-sbx`

`node index.js`

## What I Learned

This exercise helped me deepen my understanding of:

**Node.js Streams:** How to efficiently manage data flows using streams and buffers.

**Backpressure:** The critical role of managing resource allocation and recovery in real-time systems.

**Throttling in the Producer-Consumer Pattern:** How to build robust systems that can handle varying speeds between data generation and processing.

## Possible Future Improvements

**Transform Streams:** I plan to implement transform streams to modify the data between the producer and consumer, creating a more complex data pipeline.

**Testing:** Adding unit and integration tests to simulate real-world scenarios, such as handling large files or multiple clients.

**Error Handling:** Enhancing error handling to deal with unexpected stream failures.
